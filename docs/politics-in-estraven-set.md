# Politics in Estraven (Core Deck)

## Vision Design

The Core Deck should represent the baseline **themes, tone, and mechanics** of *Lords of Estraven*.  
Its focus is **“Politics in Estraven”**: intrigue, shifting loyalties, manipulation, and control.  
The Core Deck provides the foundation from which Theme decks build more specialized strategies.

---

### Core Themes
- **Intrigue & Bluffing**: Politics is not direct combat, but maneuvering and deception.  
- **Shifting Power**: Lords and Dukes rise and fall in influence; temporary alliances matter.  
- **Hidden Agendas**: Face-down Dukes, Victory cards, and market manipulation reinforce secrecy.  
- **Slow Escalation**: Political games often begin with subtle moves, building into dramatic power shifts.

### Mechanical Pillars

#### 1. **Influence as Currency**
- Politics revolves around *soft power* instead of brute force.  
- Influence could be:
  - A **resource subtype** (e.g. Influence cards that can be spent).  
  - A **counter system** placed on cards to represent political clout.  
- Influence may unlock abilities, reduce costs, or be traded away for short-term gain.

#### 2. **Negotiation & Manipulation**
- Effects that encourage indirect play:
  - “Choose an opponent: they gain X, you gain Y.”  
  - “Target Duke: flip face up unless its controller pays a cost.”  
  - “Trade resources with another player.”  
- Players are rewarded for manipulating others into unfavorable positions.

#### 3. **Council Dynamics**
- Lords and Dukes form a **governing body**.  
- Possible mechanics:
  - **Council votes**: Certain cards may require players to secretly vote yes/no with Influence counters.  
  - **Duke agendas**: Dukes might give benefits while face down, different ones when revealed.  
  - **Council Strain**: Too many active Dukes could trigger penalties, representing political instability.

#### 4. **Public vs. Private Power**
- Duality between:
  - **Face-up cards** = overt political moves (risky but powerful).  
  - **Face-down cards** = hidden leverage (safe but weak until revealed).  
- Politics deck should thrive on balancing hidden and revealed plays.

### Example Card Concepts

- **Council Edict (Ritual)**  
  “At the start of each player’s turn, they must pay 1 Influence or fatigue a Duke.”  
  → Represents constant pressure of governance.

- **Whispers in the Court (Spell)**  
  “Look at a face-down Duke. You may spend 2 powerstones to flip it.”  
  → Information as a weapon.

- **Political Scandal (Event)**  
  “For 3 turns, whenever a Duke is revealed, its controller loses 2 Influence.”  
  → Represents the volatility of Estraven’s nobility.

- **Golden Favor (Item – Boon)**  
  “Attach to a Duke. Once per turn, you may spend 1 Influence to reduce a cost by 1.”  
  → Buying loyalty.

### Role of the Core Deck
- Establishes **baseline mechanics**: Influence, council dynamics, hidden vs revealed.  
- Acts as a **neutral canvas** onto which Theme decks layer factional or cultural flavor.  
- Ensures all games have an underlying “political drama,” even if themes differ (war, religion, economics).
