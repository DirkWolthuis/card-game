# The Lost Stories of Estraven — A Magic: The Gathering Variant

## Goals of this format variant

This format is an experiment to see how specific rule changes influence the pace and feel of a Magic game. A version of these rules was written as a stand-alone game, and by using Magic: The Gathering as an engine it becomes easier to test them. This format aims to:

- Create a closed environment that feels more like a board game and is less complex
- Create a closed environment to test custom cards
- Give players and format developers a platform for more storytelling in their games and decks
- Tie mana resources to card in hand resource
- Emphasize the strategic use of resources by tieing mana to card in hand and amount of cards left in library
- Provide a built-in way to use out of deck cards

## Rules

### Game setup

In The Lost Stories of Estraven players take on a scenario. A scenario constists out of unique faction decks and a (shared) story deck. For the MVP this format supports 1v1 play only. Each scenario can add additional rules, restrictions or setup requirements.

#### The story deck

In addition to the player decks, a scenario contains a pre-constructed shared story deck. The shared deck is used to fill the marketplace and to generate 'events'.

#### The Marketplace

The Marketplace is a new shared zone populated with cards from the story deck. It has five slots, and at the start of the game five cards are placed in the slots. Number the slots of the Marketplace 1 to 5. At the end of each turn, the last card in the market is placed at the bottom of the story deck, all other cards move one slot forward, and a new card is drawn and placed in slot 1.

#### Event cards

At the beginning of a player's end phase, that player rolls a D6. If the result is a 5 or a 6, they draw a card from the story deck and cast that card without paying its mana costs. If the card can't be casted (due to lack of legal targets, the puts the card their hand).

### Draw phase

In addition to drawing a card, players draw additional cards until they have seven cards in hand.

_Design note: Really unsure about this rule. Should test with and without it._

### Additional player abilities

All rare and mythic rare cards in hand gain the ability: `Pitch — Exile this card: Add 3 mana of any one color.`

All uncommon cards in hand gain the ability: `Pitch — Exile this card: Add 2 mana of any one color.`

All common cards in hand gain the ability: `Pitch — Exile this card: Add 1 mana of any color.`

_Design note: Unsure about using rarity, also should test with a flat value._

All cards in hand gain the ability: `Trade — Pay {1}: Swap this card with any card from the market. Activate only as a sorcery and only twice each turn.`
