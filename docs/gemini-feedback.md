Ok, I will awnser the questions. Can you make edits in the game design document to reflect the awnsers?

High-Level & Core Vision
Q: Game Feel: What is the intended "feel" of the game? Is it a fast-paced slugfest? A slow, strategic "cold war" of building up resources? A combo-heavy game of pulling off a master plan?

A: More strategic. The fact your dukes and victory card remains hidden should lead to more cloak and dagger style of play. More strategic and slow than other card games.

Q: Player Archetypes: Your Lord and Duke choices determine playstyle. Do you envision clear archetypes like Aggro (aggressive), Control (defensive, reactive), Combo (synergy-focused), or Mid-range (balanced)?
A: Yes, based on my limited knowledge of Magic: the Gathering. Next up is design the Lord cards.

The "Shared Deck" Philosophy: This is a major, game-defining choice.

Q: When players construct their own 20-card decks, are all 40/60/80 cards shuffled together into one large library for everyone to draw from?
A: Yes

Q: If so, how does this support specific strategies? Doesn't this risk a player drawing cards that only synergize with an opponent's Lord? Or an opponent drawing your key combo piece?
A: I've reconsidered this. I think there is still one deck, but it's not constructable. It either random from booster packs (to maintain a balance) or a predefined set based around a theme.

Q: Have you considered an alternative where each player has their own deck, and perhaps the Market is drawn from a separate, neutral deck?
A: Yes, but that is too close to existing games

Game Setup & Resources
Q: Powerstones vs. Powerbeads: Your turn structure mentions players "loose all powerbeads but one," but then "receive one powerstone." Are these the same resource? If not, what are powerbeads and how are they generated/used? Let's assume they are the same ("powerstones") for now.
A: They mean the same. I want to use the Powerstone term for now.

The Market Zone:

Q: When a player trades a card from their hand for a market card, where does the card from their hand go? To the discard pile? Back into the market slot? To the bottom of the shared deck?
A: You trade it, so it will go into the market.

Q: Can a player perform this market trade multiple times per turn if they have the powerstones?
A: Once a turn.

Q: How is the market refilled? When a card is taken, is it immediately replaced from the top of the deck?
A: End of each turn, oldest card goes into the discard pile and a new one is drawn into the market from the deck.

The Resource Economy:

Q: What do you get for "spending" a Resource card (placing a fatigue token on it)? Does it generate powerstones, or is it a non-powerstone prerequisite for another action (e.g., "To cast this spell, pay 3 powerstones and spend 1 Influence")?
A: Nothing, you only spend to pay for something else. Or rules on the resource should say otherwise.

Q: How do the 'Powerstone' economy and the 'Resource' card economy interact? Are they used for different types of costs?
A: Powerstones are the main currency, resources are more optional and should be constructed/picked during the game. They are spend useed for different types of costs.

Q: Can a Resource card be used (i.e., have a fatigue token placed on it) on the same turn it is played?
A: Yes.

Card Types & Interactions
Lords:

Q: What is a Lord's starting health total? Is it standard for all Lords, or unique to each one?
A: It's printed on the card, can be different.

Q: Besides their abilities, do Lords have any inherent actions? Can a Lord "attack" an opponent's Lord or Duke by default each turn? If so, how much damage does it do?
A: No, no inherent abilities. Everything it can do is printed on the card.

Dukes:

Q: What is the strategic value of keeping Dukes face down? Is it for bluffing, or to hide information about your strategy?
A: Hide strategy.

Q: Can Dukes be targeted by damage/effects while face down?
A: No unless rules specificly mention otherwise

Q: What is their role in combat? Can they attack? Can they intercept damage meant for the Lord (i.e., act as "taunts" or "blockers")?
A: There is no combat phase. They can only do what their card abilities mention.

Q: What happens to Items attached to a Duke if the Duke is destroyed?
A: idk they could be re-equipt I guess but that might be too much like magic. Can you suggest a solution?

Items:

Q: How is an Item "coupled" to a Lord or Duke? Is it played from hand by paying its cost and placed next to the character?
A: Yes, maybe an extra cost if we do re-equiping.

Q: Is there a limit to how many Items can be coupled to one character? (e.g., only one Gear, one Artifact, etc.)?
A: No.

Victory Cards:

Q: Does it cost powerstones to attempt to play your Victory card?
A: No, but it maybe should? 1 for the first time and one more for each attempt?

Q: You mention the card is returned revealed if the conditions aren't met on resolution. Is there any other penalty? If not, what prevents a player from trying to play it every single turn for free once the conditions are close?
A: See above. 

Q: Can an opponent's Reaction card specifically target and "counter" a Victory card, sending it to the discard pile and effectively eliminating that win condition for the player?
A: In theory, but I'm not sure I would design that card.

Spells & Reactions:

Q: Since Reactions use a stack, can players play a Reaction in response to another Reaction? How deep can the stack go?
A: Yes, infinite if there were infinite resources. 

Q: Is there a general rule for targeting? Can any damage spell target any card with a health value (Lords and Dukes), or are there restrictions?
A: No restrictions other than abilities that have an effect on this. 

Main Mechanics & Turn Flow
Q: Dealing Damage: How is damage primarily dealt in the game?
A: By activating abilities that deal damage. 

Q: Is it mainly through Spells and abilities?
A: Yes. 

Q: Is there a dedicated "Combat Phase" where Lords/Dukes can attack each other? If so, how does it work? (e.g., Player declares attackers, opponent declares blockers).
A: No.

Q: Hand Size: Is there a maximum hand size? If so, what happens if a player ends their turn with more cards than the maximum?
A: I guess there should. 5?

Q: Deck Depletion: What happens when the shared deck runs out of cards? Does the game end in a draw? Do players lose? Is the discard pile shuffled to become a new deck?
A: the cards are shuffled back in.

Passing the Turn:

Q: The turn passes automatically if a player can't do anything. Does this include not having enough powerstones for any action, even if they have playable cards in hand?
A: Yes. 

Q: If a player can take actions but chooses to pass, do they get to keep their unspent powerstones (up to the one carryover)?
A: Yes they can spend them on reactions for example. 

Play Modes & Construction Rules
Deck Construction:

Q: Are there any restrictions on deck building besides the 20-card count? (e.g., "no more than 2 copies of any single card").
A: See earlier awnser, the deck is not longer comstructable. 

Q: In constructed modes, how do players ensure their deck functions if it's being shuffled with 1-3 other players' decks? This seems like the most critical area to clarify.
A: See above

Drafting:

Q: In the draft, what is a "booster"? How many cards are in it?
A: Don't know yet, first need to make card designs. 

Q: When drafting the shared deck, the rule says "discards another card." Where does this discarded card go? Is it removed from the game entirely? This is important as it affects the total card pool.
A: Don't know yet.
