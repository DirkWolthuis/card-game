# Lords of Estraven card game design

Lords of Estraven (LOE) is a 2-4 player card game. The game is designed to be played with physical cards. Players play as a lord in charge of a province of the continent Estraven, fighting and plotting to gain control over other provinces. The core elements of the game are the lord (the main card of the player, with special abilities determinates the play style the most), up to 4 dukes (smaller character cards that support the lord) and a victory card (a win condition).

## Card types

### How do cards work?

#### Council

The combination of your Lord and Duke cards are refered to as your council.

#### Lord

The lord card is revealed at the start of the game. The lord cards have a cost, but is only used for the sake of abilities and effects. Lords always start in play unless its rules specify otherwise.

#### Duke

Duke cards start the game face down and can be activated by paying their cost. You can only activate Duke cards during your turn unless an effect specifically allows you otherwise.

#### Resources

Resource cards are used to pay for abilities or needed to meet a Victory card condition. When a card mentions a resource as a cost, it means you must spend that resource by placing a fatigue token on it. Players can only play one resource card per turn. Most resource cards have an additional effect that can be activated or triggers when played. Type or resource cards include Subjects, Materials, and Influence.

#### Victories

Victory cards represent a (alternative) win condition for the game. Each player can only have one victory card in play at a time. To win the game, a player must fulfill the conditions specified on their victory card. If a player's victory card is successfully played and its conditions are met when the card resolves, that player wins the game. When the conditions are not met when the card resolves, the card is returned to the player and is kept revealed for the rest of the game.

#### Spells

Spells are cards with a one time effect, can be played by paying their cost. Spells can only be cast during your turn unless an effect specifically allows you otherwise.

#### Reactions

Reactions are cards that can be played in response to an ability or effect. The timing and conditions for playing a reaction are specified on the card.

#### Items

Item cards represent various objects or equipment. All items are coupled to a specific Lord or Duke card in play. Type or item cards include Artifacts, Gear, Classes, Boons

#### Rituals

Rituals cards produce a continuous effect as long as they are in play. Usually a symmetrical effect.

## Main mechanics

- Cards can be played by paying their cost (visualized on the card with a number and powerstone symbol) and additional cost if relevant
- Some cards have a health value, which represents their durability or resistance. Cards with a health value can be the target of damage or other effects that interact with health. When a card with a health value is dealt damage, it receives a number of damage counters equal to the damage dealt. If a card's health value is reduced to zero or below, it is destroyed and sent to the discard pile. Health value is tracked using damage counters and not automatically removed unless an effect specifies otherwise.
- When the effect of cards break the game rules, the effect takes precedence
- When an card has 'spend' as an effect or cost, then place a fatigue token on relevant card
- Cards with a fatigue token cannot activate abilities with spend as cost
- Reactions can be played in reaction to an ability or card/effect, the reaction will define when it can be played
- Resolving effects/cards is done with a stack, last in -- first out
- Dukes can be played by paying the cost. When playing reveal/flip the card
- You can play your victory card, if it resolves you win the game and other players loose. Opponents can react to playing a victory card in the same way as other cards. When your victory card resolves, but the conditions on the card are no longer met, the card returns face up under control of its owner. You can only play victory cards once a turn
