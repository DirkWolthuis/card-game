# Lords of Estraven card game design
Lords of Estraven (LOE) is a 2-4 player card game. The game is designed to be played with physical cards. Players play as a lord in charge of a province of the continent Estraven, fighting and plotting to gain control over other provinces.
## Design Philosophy
The intended feel of the game is strategic and methodical. With key information like a player's Dukes and Victory card hidden at the start, the gameplay should encourage a "cloak and dagger" style of play, rewarding careful planning, bluffing, and deduction over raw aggression. It is designed to be a slower, more thoughtful experience than many other card games. The choice of Lord and Dukes is intended to support various playstyle archetypes, such as control, combo, and mid-range strategies.

How do cards work?
Council
The combination of your Lord and Duke cards are referred to as your council.
Lord
The lord card is revealed at the start of the game. The lord cards have a cost, but this is only used for the sake of abilities and effects. Lords always start in play unless their rules specify otherwise. A Lord's starting health is printed on the card and can be different for each Lord. Lords have no inherent actions (like a default attack); everything a Lord can do is printed on the card.
Duke
Duke cards start the game face down and can be activated (flipped face up) by paying their cost. You can only activate Duke cards during your turn unless an effect specifically allows you otherwise. While face down, Dukes cannot be targeted by abilities or effects unless a card rule specifically allows it. Like Lords, Dukes can only perform actions described on their card.
Resources
Resource cards are used to pay for abilities or meet a Victory card condition. When a card mentions a resource as a cost (e.g., "Spend 1 Influence"), it means you must place a fatigue token on a corresponding resource card you control. Players can only play one resource card per turn. Most resource cards have an additional effect that can be activated or triggers when played. A resource card can be spent on the same turn it is played. Types of resource cards include Subjects, Materials, and Influence.
Victories
Victory cards represent an alternative win condition. Each player has one Victory card. To win via this method, a player must play the card and successfully fulfill the conditions specified on it when the card resolves.
Playing a Victory card: The first attempt to play your Victory card costs 1 powerstone. Each subsequent attempt costs 1 more powerstone than the last (e.g., 1, then 2, then 3).
Resolution: Opponents can react to a Victory card being played. If the card resolves and its conditions are met, that player wins the game. If the conditions are no longer met when it resolves, the card is returned to its owner's play zone, face up, and it remains revealed for the rest of the game.
Spells
Spells are cards with a one-time effect, played by paying their cost. Spells can only be cast during your turn unless an effect specifically allows you otherwise.
Reactions
Reactions are cards that can be played in response to an ability or effect, using the stack. The timing and conditions for playing a reaction are specified on the card.
Items
Item cards represent objects or equipment. To play an Item, you pay its cost and couple it to a specific Lord or Duke card in play, placing it next to that card. There is no limit to how many Items can be coupled to one character. If a Lord or Duke is destroyed, any Items coupled to it are also sent to the discard pile. Types of item cards include Artifacts, Gear, Classes, and Boons.
Rituals
Ritual cards produce a continuous, and usually symmetrical, effect as long as they are in play.
Main mechanics
Paying Costs: Cards are played by paying their powerstone cost (visualized on the card with a number and powerstone symbol) and any additional costs (like spending resources).
Health and Damage: Some cards have a health value. Damage is dealt through card abilities. When a card is dealt damage, it receives an equal number of damage counters. If a card's damage counters equal or exceed its health, it is destroyed and sent to the discard pile. Damage counters are not removed unless an effect specifies otherwise.
Combat: There is no dedicated combat phase. All damage and interaction between cards are handled exclusively through card abilities and effects.
Golden Rule: When the effect of a card breaks the game rules, the card's effect takes precedence.
Spending: When an effect or cost says to 'spend' a card (e.g., a Resource), you place one fatigue token on that card.
Fatigue: Cards with a fatigue token cannot be spent again or use abilities that require spending as a cost.
The Stack: Resolving effects, spells, and reactions is done with a stack. The last card or ability added to the stack is the first one to resolve (Last In, First Out). Players can play a Reaction in response to another Reaction, with the stack depth limited only by player resources.
Targeting: Unless a card specifies otherwise (e.g., "cannot be targeted"), any card can be targeted by an ability that could logically affect it (e.g., a damage spell can target any card with a health value).
Hand Size: Players have a maximum hand size of 7 cards. At the end of their turn, if a player has more than 7 cards, they must discard down to the limit.
Deck Depletion: If the shared deck runs out of cards, the discard pile is shuffled to create a new deck.
Play modes
The shared deck is not constructed by individual players. It is formed at the start of the game using one of the following methods.
Sealed Deck: Each player opens a number of "deck boosters" and all cards from these boosters are shuffled together to form the shared deck. Players construct their council and pick a victory card from their personal collection.
Council Constructed: The game uses a pre-defined, themed shared deck that all players draw from. Players bring their own pre-constructed council and victory card.
Full Draft:
Council Draft: A "lords and dukes booster" is opened. Each player chooses one card to add to their council, then passes the remaining cards. This repeats until all players have a full council.
Sealed Deck: Each player opens a number of "deck boosters" and all cards from these boosters are shuffled together to form the shared deck.
Victory Draft: All victory cards are shuffled. Each player is dealt 3, and secretly chooses one to use.
Turn Sequence
Before the game:
All council cards start face down.
Victory cards start face down.
The shared deck is shuffled.
The top 5 cards of the deck are placed face up in the market zone.
Each player flips their Lord card face up.
Each player draws 5 cards.
Start of a Player's Turn:
Untap: The player removes all fatigue tokens from cards they control.
Upkeep: The player loses all but one of their unspent powerstones from the previous turn.
Draw: The player draws a card.
Main Phase:
The player receives powerstones equal to the current turn number, to a maximum of 10 (1 on turn 1, 2 on turn 2, ..., 10 on turn 10 and beyond).
The player can perform the following actions in any order:
Play cards from their hand.
Activate abilities on cards they control.
Trade with the Market (once per turn): Pay 1 powerstone to swap one card from their hand with one card in the market. The card from their hand is placed into the empty market slot.
End of Turn:
If the player can take no more actions or chooses to pass, their turn ends.
Market Refresh: The card that has been in the market the longest is sent to the discard pile. A new card is revealed from the top of the deck to fill the empty slot.
