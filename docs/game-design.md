# Lords of Estraven (LOE) Card Game Design

Lords of Estraven (LOE) is a 2-4 player card game played with physical cards. As a lord of a province on the continent of Estraven, players must scheme and battle to gain control over other provinces.

## Design Philosophy

The game is intended to feel strategic and methodical.  
The hidden nature of key information, like a player’s Dukes and Victory card, promotes a *“cloak and dagger”* style of play.  

Success comes from careful planning, bluffing, and deduction rather than raw aggression.  
The game is designed to be a slower, more thoughtful experience.  

Players can choose their Lord and Dukes to support different playstyles, from control and combo to mid-range strategies.

## Card Types

- **Council**: Your Lord and Duke cards make up your council.  
- **Lord**: Revealed at the start of the game, a Lord’s starting health is printed on the card. They always start in play and have no inherent actions; everything they can do is printed on the card.  
- **Duke**: Duke cards start the game face down. They can be activated (flipped face up) by paying their cost during your turn. While face down, they cannot be targeted by abilities or effects.  
- **Resources**: Used to pay for abilities or meet Victory card conditions. When a resource is spent, you place a fatigue token on the card. You can only play one resource card per turn. Types include Subjects, Materials, and Influence.  
- **Victories**: Each player has one Victory card, representing an alternative win condition. To win this way, you must play the card and successfully fulfill its conditions. Often it will take multiple turns before the condition is met, giving opponents time to react. Most will also give opponents benefits while the Victory card is in play. Victory cards have a powerstone cost.  
- **Spells**: Cards with a one-time effect, cast by paying their cost during your turn.  
- **Reactions**: Cards that can be played in response to an ability or effect, using the stack.  
- **Items**: Represent objects or equipment. When played, an Item is coupled to a specific Lord or Duke. If the character is destroyed, any attached Items are also sent to the discard pile. Types include Artifacts, Gear, Classes, and Boons.  
- **Rituals**: Ritual cards produce a continuous, usually symmetrical, effect as long as they are in play.  
- **Events**: Event cards have different effects for a set duration of time, usually symmetrical and escalating in impact. They are discarded when their last effect is resolved.

## Main Mechanics

- **Paying Costs**: Cards are played by paying their powerstone cost and any additional costs.  
- **Health and Damage**: When a card with a health value takes damage, it receives an equal number of damage counters. If the counters meet or exceed its health, the card is destroyed.  
- **Combat**: There is no dedicated combat phase. All damage and interaction are handled through card abilities and effects.  
- **Golden Rule**: If a card’s effect contradicts a game rule, the card’s effect takes precedence.  
- **Spending and Fatigue**: When a card is *spent*, a fatigue token is placed on it. A card with a fatigue token cannot be spent again or use abilities that require spending as a cost until the token is removed.  
- **The Stack**: Effects, spells, and reactions resolve on a stack. The last card added is the first to resolve (Last In, First Out).  
- **Targeting**: Any card can be targeted by an ability that could logically affect it unless the card specifies otherwise.  
- **Hand Size**: The maximum hand size is 7 cards. Players must discard down to this limit at the end of their turn.  
- **Deck Depletion**: If the shared market deck runs out of cards, the discard pile is shuffled to create a new deck.

## Play Modes

The shared market deck is formed at the start of the game using the following method:
1. Players secretly choose their council: 1 Lord, up to 4 Dukes, and 1 Victory card.  
2. Each player chooses one Theme deck. They combine it with the Core deck to form their player deck.  
3. Before the game begins, each player contributes 5 random cards from their deck to the market deck.

## Turn Sequence

**Before the game:**
1. All council and Victory cards are face down.  
2. Each player contributes 5 random cards to the market deck. Shuffle to form the shared market deck.  
3. Place the top 5 cards of the market deck face up in the market zone.  
4. Each player flips their Lord card face up.  
5. Each player draws 5 cards.  

**Start of a Player’s Turn:**
- Remove all fatigue tokens from your cards.  
- Lose all but one of your unspent powerstones.  
- Draw one card.  

**Main Phase:**
1. Gain **X powerstones**, where **X = that player’s current turn number** (not cumulative), up to a maximum of 10.  
2. Perform any of the following actions in any order:  
   - Play cards from your hand.  
   - Activate abilities on cards you control.  
   - **Trade with the Market (once per turn)**: Pay 1 powerstone to swap a card from your hand with one in the market.  

**End of Turn:**
- Your turn ends when you have no more actions or choose to pass.  
- **Market Refresh**: The card that has been in the market the longest (the card on the left if the deck is on the right) is sent to the discard pile, and a new card is revealed from the top of the market deck and placed on the right side.
